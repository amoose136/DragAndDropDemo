A simple set of 3 files I made to explore options for creating drag and drop file uploads.

# demo.html
The first demo file is a simple javascript enabled file uploader that will only accept svg or jpg files and provides feedback to the user.
This demo was made primarily with the help of [GPT 4.0](https://chat.openai.com/share/3def4996-89cb-49bf-ac05-17a766776257).

# demo2.html
The second demo tries to do as much as possible of the first demo file but does so with only html/css and no javascript. You can click the button to open a file upload dialog and it will filter to only allowed types by default. You can also drag and drop over the form and it will provide feedback that a file has been selected but it can't check that the type is right without javasript.
This demo was made using [this reference](https://codepen.io/Scribblerockerz/pen/qdWzJw) I found at [this stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45249452) and [GPT 4.0](https://chat.openai.com/share/3def4996-89cb-49bf-ac05-17a766776257)

# mimetypes.html
The final file is just a diagnostics file that tries to tell you as much as possible about files and objects being dragged over it.
